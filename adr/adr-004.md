# WebP

- **Issue**: Should we use WebP to help with site performance and Google Insight ratings.

- **Decision**: We are going to hold off on implementing WebP for now but reevalutate in the future.

- **Status**: decided

- **Background**: WebP is an image format employing both lossy and lossless compression, and supports animation and alpha transparency. Developed by Google, it is designed to create files that are smaller for the same quality, or of higher quality for the same size, than JPEG, PNG, and GIF image formats.

- **Assumptions**: We will eventually want to add WebP to meet new Google search engine ranking standard. 

- **Constraints**: WebP isn't full supported yet in Safari. Currently Safari in Big Sur and on can handle WebP fine but there is a large amount of users still on Catalina. https://caniuse.com/webp https://www.statista.com/statistics/944559/worldwide-macos-version-market-share/ If you want to support all browsers you would need to add <picture> tags and multiple sources. This works but breaks responsive image. https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3213491 The big modules I've found that are recommended for WebP are both pretty out of date (a year or more) so I'll need to keep searching if this is something we're wanting to do still.

- **Positions**: The current image types we're using work fine however as Google changes optimization rules for search rankings we will eventually want to switch to WebP.

- **Argument**: WebP is beginning to be more widely used at this time but the lack of support in Catalina is a a major reason not to add the functionality yet. The lack of Drupal support is also enough of an issue that it is worth waiting for wider implementation on the CMS.

- **Implications**: Because of the Catalina and Drupal lack of support we will need to continue using jpg, png, and gif image formats. This shouldn't cause any issues right now.
