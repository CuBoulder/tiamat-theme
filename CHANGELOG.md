  Resolves #651 
---

- ### Newsletter: Minor Bug Fixes
  Adjusts the following on the Newsletter:
  - If user elects to omit the optional image on a _Newsletter Taxonomy_, it will no longer render that img element in the header
  - **Article Sections ( _Feature Style_ )** - For the Feature Style Article Sections, Articles without a thumbnail will check the Article for an Image uploaded as Article Content, and use that in place of a thumbnail if available. This functionality worked in the Teaser display, but there was an error that would prevent the backup image to display in the Feature Style render.

These spans did not appear to be used anywhere else in d10, so they were removed to resolve the issue.
  
  Resolves #586 
  
---

- ### Fixes error on Newsletter pages
  Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#596
---

- ### Fixes Embedded Video not displaying, if also Aligned
  Adds a custom CSS override to Embedded Videos, if also aligned via CKeditor5, in order to prevent a visual bug where they becoming hidden if floated left/right or centered on a rendered page. This bug was caused by our customized embedded video style and the default alignments (left,right,center) conflicting. 
  
  Resolves #561
---

- ### Standardizes padding at the top of pages
  This theme update:
  - Corrects padding at the top of pages to a standard `20px`. Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#579
  - Cleans up some code in multiple content type templates and stylesheets.
  
  It may take longer to test due to the number of files changed.
---

- ### Secondary Menu Updates
  Closes #551.
  Adds button functionality to secondary menu and fixes other small misalignments.
---

- ### Adds Styling to Newsletters
  Adds the following switchable styles to the email version of the Newsletter: Classic, Minimal, Light-Boxed, Dark-Boxed, Simple. 
  
  This change also applies the selected `Newsletter` taxonomy's custom header image and footer into your email HTML. 
  
  For testing:
  - Create a taxonomy for `Newsletter`-- choose a custom header image, create a footer, and select a style. 
  - Select this taxonomy when creating a Newsletter page.
  - After creating your page go to `Edit` and `Preview`. After selecting preview, on the right hand side change the `View Mode` dropdown to `Email: HTML`
  - If you click the `Click to copy your Newsletter HTML` button, your email HTML will automatically be copied to clipboard, or you can select the HTML from the input. You can demo this by creating an HTML file and doing a Live Preview, or using a program like Email on Acid to test display ( although this will not show images served by localhost)
  
  I recommend two tabs when testing styles, one with the Email:HTML preview and one with `Edit taxonomy` term to change styles or other fields, then just refresh the Email:HTML preview. 
  
  Resolves #273 , Resolves #137 , Resolves #305

-   ### Styles search results page

    Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#535 â€“ A site's search page created using the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://www.drupal.org/project/google_cse) module is now styled properly. Correct settings for the search page (may already be defaults):

    -   Display Drupal-provided search input: **âœ“**
    -   Display search results: **On this site (requires JavaScript)**
    -   Layout of Search Engine: **Results only**

-   ### Fixes List Indicator Alignment with Left Align Images

    This change aligns the list indicators on a list element with other text elements next to a left-aligned image. 

    Previously, the float css for aligning an element left would cause visual issues with list indicators specifically, the bullet-point or numbering becoming hard to see or lost within the image. There is now condtionally applied left-spacing to rendered Ordered and Unordered list elements, when directly next to a Left Align (.align-left) image. 

    Resolves #523 

* * *

-   ### Remove Extra Markup from inserted Images

    Conditionally removes extra `<div>` elements added through Twig when there's no attributes to justify an additional `<div>` wrap of the rendered content. 

    Changes default div styling of the imageMediaStyle class to not be `display:block`, both of which caused issues with wrapping an image in an anchor tag making the entire row clickable rather than just the image.

    Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/522>

* * *

-   ### Add editor style options
    Closes #515.

-   ### Article List Block - Style Adjustments & Summary Bug Fix

    ## Article Block Bug Fix

    -   Fixes bug with article summaries not displaying if they are derived from the body content, in lieu of the `Summary` field. This bug was present across `Article List Block`, `Article Grid Block`, `Article Feature Block` and has been corrected.

    * * *

    ## Style Adjustments

    Adjusts the following styles of the `Article List Block`:

    ### All `Article List Block` Styles

    -   Thumbnail images set to 50px on mobile.
    -   Article borders set to 1px.
    -   `Link URL` is no longer a button-style link and is now a right-aligned basic link on the `Article List Block` specifically.

    ### Teaser Display

    -   Sets thumbnails to 100px, 50px on mobile.
    -   Adjusts layout to not force image above article card summary and details on single and multi column widths.

    ### Feature with Wide Photo

    -   Uses the `Focal Image Wide` thumbnail for the images in `Article List Blocks` rendered in `Feature with Wide Photo` style. This image style was not previously available via JSON API when the block was initially created.

    ### Thumbnail & Title Displays

    -   Thumbnail image 65px, 50px on mobile.
    -   Equalizes padding above and below each article card, removing padding from images.

-   ### Hero unit work

    Fixed the hero unit videos to work/fit properly in the new layout builder settings. Added "Size Priority" as an option to hero units so that we can have 100vh sections. Video now uses the 100vh by default because otherwise it's crazy ugly (can be easily changed now that I've refactored some of the css)

    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/74>

    Closes #481

-   ### Re-factor of Drupal Regions to more closely match D7 Express

    Added new regions to to .info
    Added new region rendering to page
    Changed where the slogan is displayed in .theme
    Added new `site-information.html.twig` for new region where slogan is displayed
    Updated `footer.html.twig` to iterate through content so that it automatically adds columns (up to 4 per row)

    I left our current machine names for items like `left_sidebar` the same but changed their display names to match the ones given by Kevin to `Sidebar First`

    We also have logic written in the page.html.twig in case two sidebars are made through the block layout. Currently the settings only allow for one though.

    I have left social media menu and footer menu as regions for the time being because I think those need to be separate for menuing purposes at the moment.
