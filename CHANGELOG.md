## [Unreleased]

## [20250312] - 2025-03-12

- ### Newsletter: Dark Boxed email's Article sections in Outlook on PC have no background

  Due to how Microsoft Outlook on Windows 10/11 uses a custom render engine based on Microsoft Word instead of anything standardized, the `Dark-Box` style of email was hard to read and would come through with missing backgrounds. This has been adjusted to conditionally render wrapping elements to help try to enforce background.

  Resolves #1608

- ### D11 version bump
  D11 version bump

* * *

- ### Background color addition

  Add white background color to content sequence cards so they aren't transparent on background images.

  Resolves #1611 

* * *

## [20250226] - 2025-02-26

- ### Newsletter: Fixes pathing and size of images within Newsletter Content Blocks

  Previously images placed in the Newsletter Blocks `Newsletter Block Text` section would show up in the Email HTML with relative pathing and no fixed style sizes, resulting in very broken images. This has been corrected so images should render at full-width of their section at both options -- one Block at full width OR multiple Blocks side by side. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1605>

- ### Update style.css

  Klaro override style needed for brand color.

## [20250219] - 2025-02-19

- ### Remove stray JS that breaks forms
  Think this is the culprit behind broken forms -- need to test to see what config we enabled just to work around this issue-casuing bit of code can stay and what can go from `profile`

* * *

## [20240212] - 2025-02-12

- ### New Article Paragraph

  Added new paragraph template for secondary article content.

  Updated css on articles so that content isn't justified and aligned for everything, just blockquotes

  Resolves #1597 

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/200>

* * *

## [20250205] - 2025-02-05

- ### Adds the Bluesky logos to Newsletter Social Media options, adds files

  This enables the Newsletter to include Bluesky links in the Social Media area of the footer with the proper Bluesky Logo. Adds in a black and a white bluesky logo pngs.

  Helps resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1587>

* * *

- ### Update menu--social-media-menu.html.twig

  Add bluesky as an option to the social media menus

  Resolves #1587 

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-libraries/pull/7>

* * *

- ### Aggregators will only display error messages to Authenticated Users

  Previously Aggregator/ API-driven content would show various Error messaging to reflect Content-Aggregator blocks failure to display results, such as No Results found, API errors, overly aggressive filtering, etc. intended to prompt site-editors to take action and intervene to fix the content to display properly. These errors would show indiscriminately of a user's role. 

  This has been adjusted so Anonymous users don't see the Error messaging and only show it to Authenticated users. This includes pages such as the Article List Page, the People List Page as well as blocks such as Article aggregator blocks, People List block, taxonomy clouds, and more. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1392>

* * *

## [20250129] - 2025-01-29

- ### People Lists: Fix short body fields not displaying. Refines Alphabetical sorting of lists
  - On the People List Page and People List Block, previously Person pages with a short body field would not show that in these aggregator displays due to a logic bug which would only trigger if the Person page returned had to generate a summary, in cases where the body was too long. This would lead to short Person page body fields not displaying. This bug has been corrected. Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1572>
  - Previously on the People List Page  if the People were sorted by Last Name but some People shared a Last Name, it would display them in order of creation. This has been corrected so that it will sort by Last Name, and then First Name in cases of shared last names. Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1573>

* * *

- ### Adjusting weights for CSS files and removing weights from JS libraries

  Additional work to get the CSS files loading the proper order after the 10.4 update.  

  Among other issues will resolve #1577 

* * *

- ### Update boulder_base.libraries.yml

  Updated the weights in libraries to work properly in `10.4.1`

  Main problems we've seen so far were regions not being ordered properly which messed up the menus and font colors on backgrounds. This should solve those problems.

  This will need some testing. On my dev environment it looks like all my blocks and regions are appearing correctly now. 
  I don't know if this is still a stop-gap for `D11` or not? I didn't think the weights were supposed to work this way but this seems to have done it.

  Resolves #1579 
  Resolves #1578
  Resolves #1577
  Resolves #1576

- ### Update block--events-calendar.html.twig

  Switching the block container to a web component name to handle the block being stripped from columns before loading content.

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_bootstrap_layouts/pull/71>

  Resolves #1574 

* * *

- ### Update ucb-brand-bar.css

  Updated padding to be `0!important` for the brand bar to avoid styleguide interference.

  Resolves #1570 

* * *

- ### #1567 Events Calendar: Allow Mini Calendar + List option

  Previously the Events Calendar block would only allow the "List" type Widget as configured by `https://calendar.colorado.edu/help/widget` and would not correctly display the "Mini Calendar + List" widget option -- which adds an interactive mini calendar to the Events Calendar block. 

  This has been corrected so both 'Widget Types' will work with the block.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1567>

* * *

## [20250121] - 2025-01-21

- ### #1562 - Mega Menu: fix Button color being over-written

  CU Buttons placed in a Mega Menu could have their text color overwritten to the default link blue due to overly aggressive css rules. This has been corrected so menu links retain their intended colors and Buttons receive their expected styles

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1562>

* * *

- ### Newsletter: Re-add domain to Article Thumbnails (Wide and Teaser) referenced in a Newsletter

  We changed how Newsletter Article images are referenced for better generation on multi-site domains in particular. With this change the primary (www.colorado.edu) domain was dropped. This has been re-added. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1561>

* * *

## [20250115] - 2025-01-15

- ### Newsletters: Fixes Absolute Pathing, Allows buttons in intro text

  Resolves #1552 

* * *

- ### Newsletter List Block: fixes pathing of linked Newsletters

  Previously the Newsletter List Block would just use the path returned via the API, which presented an issue on multisite. This has been corrected

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1556>

* * *

- ### Homepage Mobile Menu fix
  Resolves #1496.
  Adds the mobile menu toggle when the header is removed on the homepage.

* * *

- ### Removes unused include templates and settings

  This update removes the unused includes and settings originally intended for the CU Boulder homepage secondary and footer menus. They have instead built these out using the appropriate mechanisms available in Web Express and don't need custom code to support it.

  Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1537

  Sister PR in: [ucb_site_configuration](https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration/pull/77)

* * *

- ### Newsletter List Block: Adds loader and error message handling

  Previously there was no spinning loader element on the Newsletter Archive, which could present a blank screen for an uncomfortable amount of time with no feedback. This had been added, along with proper error handling for No Results, API errors, etc. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1506>

  ## Troubleshooting Issue Archive Pages

  If your Newsletter List Block is not correctly linking to the Newsletter Archive of the type you've selected, this is likely due to the creation of the term before the automatic page was created. You will need to edit the term and scroll to the bottom and select `General automatic URL Alias` which will let the pathauto module take over, and link your Block to the Archive correctly.

  Resolves #1536

## [20241211] - 2024-12-11

- ### Sidebar menu theme styles

  Styles applied when the light gray sidebar menu style option is picked in the theme configuration. Styles override basic options with new css file.

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration/pull/75>

  Resolves Issue #1513 

* * *

- ### Resolve URL Hash for mega menus
  Resolves #1536.
  Changes the functionality of the hash set function to only affect menus that are not mega menus.

* * *

- ### Related Articles: Refactors block for better relatedness scoring, faster generation

  Previously the Related Articles block could produce results that were older than expected while more recent related Articles could be missing. The block has been completely reworked to use a modern Web Component style of the other Article List blocks we've developed as well as produce better and more recent Article matches by picking through a pool of the most 50 semi-related to find the top 3.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1526>

* * *

- ### Adds Article Syndication "read more" article list

  This update adds the Article Syndication "read more" article list, for use with the Campus News block. The article list is automatically created on sites using the CU Boulder Article Syndication module (if it doesn't already exist) and aliased to `/syndicate`. It allows URL parameters to specify category, audience, and unit filters.

- ### Article Lists: Hides Dates, Decodes Special Characters in Titles of Taxonomy Term Pages

  If an Article has it's date set to 'Hide' this update will hide the date on `Category` and `Tag` Taxonomy pages as well as on the `Article List Page` and `Article List Block` displays that show the date (Teaser, Feature)

  Additionally fixes the display of special characters on Taxonomy term pages from not decoding correctly.

- ### Mega menu Link color changes
  Resolves #1530.
  Forces the color of links in the mega menu to be blue to resolve issues of links not showing up.

* * *

- ### Newsletters: allow unpublished to show in Email HTML preview

  Previously the Email HTML of Newsletters would not display unpublished Articles. Now they will display so site-editors can verify and proof content before mailing. There is a content warning on the Node of any Articles that are unpublished. 

  Note: Articles must still be manually published before sending the email, or could result in email recipients getting broken links. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1517>

* * *

- ### Remove wrap from info footer
  Resolves #1525.
  Removes wrapping from the site info contact footer to remove the extra space.

* * *

## [20241204] - 2024-12-04

- ### Class Notes List: Allow WYSIWYG Class Notes to display correctly

  Previously the Class Notes List page would strip out WYSIWYG HTML from the aggregate display. This has been adjusted so that images, links, etc added to a Class Note page via WYSIWYG editor are allowed to display while malicious input is not. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1523>

* * *

- ### Modify Image Styles in Content Rows

  Updated content rows so that teasers are using the correct image style with the right 2:1 ratio.
  A new image style was created to support this update. 
  There was also a bug with the code in which the large teasers would display as squares if the rows were unlinked. That has been updated to show correctly as wide.

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/196>

  Resolves #1503 

* * *

- ### Newsletters: Bug Fixes, Layout Adjustments

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Removed the hard-coded "View on Website" link. This will link correctly to the Newsletter page it is generated from. The hard-coded link was due to a completely re-written header and was left in unintentionally from development.  
  - Added stricter styling rules to force iOS devices to show images at the proper width. Previously they would all take on the same width on iPhones only. 
  - The blue link color should now be consistent across the Newsletter, along with removing the underline link decoration. 
  - Missing images should be fixed for complex site urls, but will need to be tested in production. 

  ### Layout Fixes

  - Adjusts spacing on the top of the newsletter. Previously there could be a large gap in between the header and the content if you intentionally left out fields such as the Intro Image or Intro Text. The conditional spacing has been tightened up to include for this case.
  - Text blocks will display at full width if there is only one in the section. Previously they would only take up 50% even if there was only one

- ### Article Feature: Fixes aspect ratio for Wide images

  Previously Article Feature Blocks with the Image Size set to `Wide (slider image style)` would come through as 3:2 aspect ratio rather than 16:9, which is used for the slider. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1501>

* * *

- ### Update ucb-brand-bar.css

  Adding consistent `max-width` and `width` to the logo's link container allows for the SVG to scale properly throughout all browsers.

  Resolves #1505 

* * *

- ### Class Notes List: special character fixes

  Previously special characters from Class Notes wouldn't escape properly, such as `&nbsp`. They are now correctly decoded.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1518>

* * *

## [20241122] - 2024-11-22

- ### Update Homepage Footer

  Removal of the `ucb-home-link` as the `{{ content }}` generates that link properly for the homepage.

  This also means we do not hide the Site Contact Info Footer in the Block Layout. The homepage is currently configured this way so that's no worry there. When they add social media links they'll just need to make sure that it is the first item in the Site Information region to stack properly.

  Updated various links to the new ones provided by Wendy

  Resolves #1493 

* * *

- ### Newsletter: Header and Footer Changes, Major Style Adjustments, Bug Fixes

  ### Changes

  - Changes the Newsletter-type title in the header to be conditional, will only appear if there is no Newsletter taxonomy image such as a logo. Previously both the newsletter-type title AND image would always display.
  - The Newsletter date will use the published date rather than update date, so it can be modified by users.
  - Footer section is now center-aligned and has a link back to the site. Also has a border top which should better indicate content separation to readers.

  ### Style Adjustments

  - Adjusts the generation of the two-column Content Block section. Some observed bugs with this includes: on iOS specifically they would not display side by side, and on some versions of Outlook they would not align correctly. This has been adjusted with better enforcement and should resolve these specific two and other Content Block section visual issues
  - Added additional email client-style override CSS so CU brand buttons should show up in more email clients.
  - Added additional email client-style overrides to try to force and ensure brand color links. Gold links on black backgrounds and blue links on white backgrounds should display in more email clients now, instead of using the Email Client's default blue for everything
  - Added additional image styles to enforce image sizing on iOS (Feature content images, teaser content images and intro images would be forced to the same size).  This may need additional production testing to further refine if issues still present

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Removes the large empty space after the header, this was due to duplicated styles being applied. 
  - Fixes an issue where the `Simple` style footer would have a white bar and white icons where the Social links should be, resulting in invisible icons

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1486>

## [20241120] - 2024-11-20

- ### Updated menu style fixes

- ### Padding for mega menu columns
  Resolves #1468
  Adds padding to the mega menu columns to prevent content overlap.

* * *

- ### Video Hero Unit Content Padding

  Adding content padding for the video hero unit to extend height more easily for users. 
  Overrides css with inline style.

  Options were added in the Design tab

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/193>

  Resolves #1477 

* * *

- ### Newsletters: New `Newsletter List Block` and `Newsletter Archive`.  Summary field added to Newsletter: Email

  Adds the `Newsletter List Block`, which allows aggregation of 1-10 of the most recent Newsletters of the selected type. Will link to the Newsletter Archive. 

  The Newsletter Archive isn't a content type, it is a route that will exist for any newsletters of the specified type listing them in a paginated view with the title and the summary. The summary will use either the summary field or the first piece of content's title. You can find the Newsletter Archive at  `/newsletter/<Newsletter-Type>`

  Also adds a Summary field to the Newsletter page, which will be used as a pre-header on the emails and used as a Summary on the Newsletter List Block and Newsletter Archive page. 

  This should show up after the Subject on an Email in specific clients such as Gmail, iOS, and others ( this will require prod - testing )

  Includes:

  - `theme` => <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/1476>
  - `profile` => <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat10-profile/pull/231>

- ### Expandable url has updates

  Series of updates to add functionality to expendables and ckeditor accordions for address bar hash updates.

  Removed the duplicate expandable block js.
  Works for expandable block's accordion/horizontal/vertical options.
  Made global so that ckeditor accordions on any page type are affected

  This does not handle nested accordions within expandable/accordion content. It doesn't need to at this moment.
  This does not affect the FAQ page's hash stuff

  Resolves #1353

* * *

## [20241118] - 2024-11-18

- ### Content List: Fixes the sidebar display's text

  Fixes text wrapping of the text on Sidebar display. Text will remain all on one row with the thumbnail image.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1169>

* * *

- ### Adds missing regions to search pages

  Previously, some regions were missing from search pages, such as the sidebar regions. This update adds those regions to search pages to match our other pages, allowing blocks to be placed in the sidebar using block layout. This fix is needed ASAP for the homepage site.

  [bug] Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1453

* * *

- ### Change footer to be sorted into rows
  Changes the direction of the footer to be flexed into rows instead.

* * *

## [20241113] - 2024-11-13

- ### Related Articles: fix relative path response

  Previously the Related Articles block would use the Article link provided by the JSON API response unmodified, which was relative and missing the subpath. This would lead to broken URLs on sites with subpaths. This has been corrected.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1464>

* * *

- ### Homepage updates

  Handful of updates for the above and below content regions as well as the homepage footer style

  Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration/pull/71>

  Resolves #1435 

* * *

- ### Newsletter: Additional Style Fixes

  - Header issues fixed including: Campus logo too small, Website link wrong color, Newsletter title too small, and date and website link should be smaller. Email header too large. Provided correct email header from Lissa ( thanks!).   **NOTE**: Link color SHOULD have all the correct client-specific and dark/light mode overrides being applied to force brand colors... but is not guaranteed to work across all clients equally due to email HTML having zero standards between clients. 
  - Fixes spacing  between border and next articles in a series of Articles or User-content. Previously the top spacing was too small.
  - Fixes a footer issue where sometimes the background wouldn't apply and there would present white text on a white background. 
  - Fixes header images cropping oddly

* * *

- ### Resolves special characters not rendering correctly in article title image captions

  This update:

  - Removes instance of `render|striptags|trim` from article title image caption template.

  [bug, severity:minor] Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1459

* * *

- ### Latest Issue Block: fix missing site subpath

  Prevents an error in the Latest Issue Block where it would fail to fetch due to a missing subpath. This has been corrected. 

  Resolves #1462 

* * *

- ### Webform: Adjusts max width at different column widths

  Fixes issue where webform blocks placed in Sections with column width 50/50 or 33/66 were too narrow. This was due to styles applied so the form would not span the full width on a single column container. 

  Adjusted so that one column layout will continue to span the 66% of the container but smaller multi-column layouts span the entire width.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1440>

- ### Adds spacing between items in a no-bullet list
  [change] Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1444

## [20241030] - 2024-10-30

- ### Articles by Person: On/off toggle

* * *

- ### Article Grid: Replaces styled square thumbnail image with wide image

  Replaces the Article Grid Block's list of Article thumbnails with the `focal_image_wide` image style, which eliminates the need for applied CSS styles on the thumbnail verion, which was not consistent across browsers.

  Previously the block was using a CSS styled version of the `focal_image_square` because our `UCB Focal Image Enable` module, which enables access to our variety of image styles via API, did not yet have access to the wide image style at the time of the Article Grid block's development. 

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1403>

- ### Adds `clearfix` for main content region
  [bug, severity:minor] Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1420

* * *

- ### Video Media: Fix floated video spacing, remove alignments on mobile screens

  - Adds spacing surrounding left and right aligned video media and the text.
  - On mobile screens-- left, right, and center alignments are removed and the video spans the full-width of the content. This prevents videos from becoming too small when floated and adjusts the Center-aligned videos to mirror the full-width look instead of maintaining pillarboxed 'centered' spacing on mobile.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1433>

* * *

- ### Add conditions for person pages with no images
  Resolves #1388.
  Adds a conditional based on the images and information fields to decide on the design of the person page.

- ### Accordions: Fixes Accordions containing Columns Overflow

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1421>

* * *

- ### Article List Page: Adds Reset button to Exposed Article List Filters and Minor Bug/QoL Fixes

  - Adds a Reset button to the user-accessible filters for Category and Tag on an Article List Page that will reset the component to the initial state
  - Fixes a bug that could present when clicking Apply Filters with 'All Category' and 'All Tags' selected that could bring in additional outside Terms from what the component initialized with and originally filtered on. This seemed to happen if you clicked Apply Filters right as the component loaded, but has been corrected.
  - Adds an error message for `No Results Found` if the provider returns any number of Articles with filters applied, but all those results get filtered out in the exclusion process. Previously there was not a case built for this with the new filters and a user could be presented with a blank component.

  Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1406>

* * *

- ### Adds missing commas and spaces between authors in article byline
  [bug, severity:minor] An issue existed where commas and spaces wouldn't be added between multiple authors in an article byline. This update resolves the issue. Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1418

  Have teaser max width be 50px

  Resolves #1349

  Fixes spacing issues for blocks in above and below content.
  Also adds proper stacking for menus in different regions

  Resolves #1407

* * *

- ### Newsletter (Web Version): Fixes desktop version display

  - Corrects an issue where a certain number of `Teaser` sections and content items with images could cause the section to "break out" of the parent container and get displayed pinned to the left, due to an error in the html template that would close the section too early if specific conditions were met.
  - If there is only one content item in a Teaser section, it will take up 100% of the space. Otherwise they will fall side by side taking up 50% of the space. This not working was also partially attributed to the above error.

- ### Article Aggregators: Adds Node ID fallback for Nodes with No Alias

  Previously there was no fallback setting on Aggregators to handle `Article` pages using `/node/#`. This could happen in situations where pathauto patterns had been turned off, and no url alias had been set. This lack of a fallback resulted in broken Article Aggregator block / page renders or broken links to these Articles. This has been corrected so both aliased and non-aliased Article pages will display with correct links for these pages across all the Content types.

  This change affects `Article List Page`, `Article List Block`, `Article Grid Block`, `Article Feature Block`, `Related Articles Block`, `Article by Person Block`, `Article Slider Block`.

- ### Issue Fixes: "Link to Issue" on Articles tag style, Issue page images, Latest Issues Block

  ### Article Page

  The tag showing that an Article appears in an Issue (below Categories and Tags) on Article pages previously had the icon appearing differently than the Category and Tag icons due to missing CSS. This has been corrected. (You will need to link an existing Issue to an Article to test via the 'Link To Issue' tab)

  ### Issue Pages

  Previously, images placed in the footer (or anywhere else for that matter) on an Issue page were showing up at 100% sizing due to not specific enough CSS being applied to all images. This has been corrected.

  ### Latest Issues Block

  We have resized the images of Issue covers that appear in the `Latest Issue` block to a larger size, mirroring the D7 version where each card takes up 25% of the horizontal container.

- ### Colorbox Image Styles: Allows 'alt' tag fallback for Caption, Fixes Floats

  These changes affect `Colorbox Small - Square`, `Colorbox Small - Thumbnail`, `Colorbox Square`, and `Colorbox Small` image styles.

  1. Previously the 4 Colorbox image styles would only use a caption for the lower description of the click to zoom functionality  that appears when zoomed. We have enabled a fallback such that if no caption is added, it will use the alt tag of the image. If no alt tag exists either, it will be blank. Resolves #1393 
  2. The Colorbox Image float left and float right were not being applied due to these being 'snowflake' images using a different template to enable the click to zoom functionality. This has been corrected and should float left or right as expected. Resolves #1379

- ### Article Aggregators: Fixes Summary Generation of handling special characters and HTML entities. Additional Article List Block Image fixes.

  ### Fixes Summary Generation Process on Article Aggregators

  Previously when an Article aggregator block had a missing `summary` field, a summary using the `body` field would be generated as a substitution it could result in HTML entities and special characters showing up incorrectly, such as `&nbsp` and `&amp`.  This has been corrected.

  This affects the following blocks: `Article List Block`, `Article Grid Block`, `Article Feature Block` as well as the `Article List Page` Content type.

- ### Article List Page: Adds user-accessible Category and Tag filters

  Adds two new toggles to the Article List Page settings, which will expose filters on Categories and Tags for page visitors. This will allow visitors to the page to further filter Articles.

  If an Article List Page has "Include" filters set on Category and/or Tag terms, only those Included terms appear as filter options in the dropdown presented to the user. If a term is set to be hidden, that term will not appear in the exposed filter, even if it's being used to initially filter the Articles.

- ### People List Page: Selecting 'Group by Job Type or Department' with Filters applied to that term, only shows allowed groupings

  Previously if you had a People List Page with `Group by` set to Department or Job Type, and had filter on that term, you could possibly see groupings of people for terms not selected in the filter, if the Person pages had multiple terms.

  For example: on <https://www.colorado.edu/alc/our-people/undergraduate-advising>, the Faculty group should not show up as it is a term applied to every Person Page, but NOT included in the filters.

  This has been corrected so only the filtered groups in the `Includes` for that term show up as a Group.

- ### body template move

  The basic page body block wasn't being rendered at the right level. This caused it not to be editable or removable at the layout builder level. If multiple body sections were added they couldn't be deleted and a "body" title was added to each new addition.

  Closes #1280 

* * *

- ### Article Title Background Update

  Removed div displayed image and set it as a background image. Set the background image to use the `section_background` image style to avoid large image files.

  Set background positioning using new preprocess in .theme Preprocess works like it does in the layout builder sections except it will update immediately if the file image's focal point is updated.

  Updated css to reflect new changes. Removal of `absolute` positioning fixes the problem with the navigation being covered by the title. Everything should scale well now.

  Changed the top padding to be 300px vs 200px to imitate the old version's bigger title image.

- ### Newsletter: Major bug fixes and style adjustments

  ### Newsletter - Node

  - Centering on Newsletter pages (the page, not the email version)  was not working correctly for user-created content in Teaser, only if an image was not supplied. This has been corrected. Resolves <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1264>

  ### Newsletter -  Email Version

  #### Major Fixes

  - Articles added to newsletters were showing `&nbsp;`  as plain text in strange places that do not appear in the original articles. This has been corrected - this would happen with Articles where no summary field is provided. The `&nbsp` was caused by how we handle generating a summary to put in place of that missing field in Twig specifically and has been adjusted
  - Newsletters are limited to 600 px wide in the preview window but when sent through Marketing Cloud and opened in Windows Outlook, and always were the full width of the window, breaking formatting. This was due to how Outlook handles image styles, needs a width attribute on the element instead of css. 
  - Additional updates have been made to try to force our colors to come through despite user selected light/dark modes on their email clients. This will likely be an ongoing process to iron out how every client handles styling base elements in their own way and how each handles light/dark mode user settings differently.
  - An issue where Footer Social media link icons appear to be broken has been fixed, this is due to an error in the path. 

  #### Minor Style Fixes

  - The CU Boulder logo at the top of newsletters is extremely large in Outlook but very tiny when the same newsletter is opened on an iPhone. Same issue as above, Outlook needed specific size attributes specified in the element itself instead of handling via CSS. 

  - Newsletter text appears as Arial in the preview window, but are Times New Roman when opened on Outlook. More Outlook specific styles have been applied, again this will likely be an ongoing process to dial in settings that work across the maximum number of browsers.

  - The horizontal rules separating sections appear in the preview window but are missing when pasted to Marketing Cloud. This has been corrected, RGBA is not a valid style and it needed to be applied to a `<table>` element instead of a `<tr>` element.

- ### Adds the Faculty Publications block

  [new] This update adds the Faculty Publications block. Faculty Publications blocks pull results from [CU Experts](https://experts.colorado.edu/). A variety of filters are available to bring near feature-parity with the version in D7. Notable changes in this version:

  - Adds an option to detect when the block has been added to a faculty member's person page, and automatically use that person's email address for the author filter.
  - Replaces the pager with a "More publications" button which loads the next batch of publications. Results are loaded fast and no longer require a reload of the page to view.
  - Removes "Any" for number of results to prevent poor client performance. 10, 25, 50, or 100 are available options.

  Previously the block almost exclusively took only the category matches under consideration and if there were none, would then check tag matches. Date was not included in these calculations and would reflect Articles in the order returned from the API.

  Finally fixed alignment of multi-column layoutbuilders + a sidebar. Though this should be a rare case, the new changes make it so all the content aligns as expected.

- ### Article List blocks: Chronological Order

  ### Article Aggregator Blocks

  Previously Article Aggregator Blocks (includes `Article List`, `Article Feature`, `Article Grid`, `Article Slider`) could sometimes display `Articles` out of chronological order. This issue was due to the asynchronous nature of the chained API calls, which could cause Articles that required additional processing (e.g., generating a summary from the article body) to be placed out of order after processing completed while other more field complete (but potentially chronologically earlier)  Articles "finished" before them.

- ### People Lists: Removing an Image breaks Lists

  ### People List Page & People List Block

  Previously in the case where you had a `People List Page` or `People List Block` and then removed an Image from the Media Library that was used as a thumbnail for a `Person` page, this would make that respective Person Page's thumbnail ID to become `'missing'` rather than a `null` value, which would cause the Person List Page to completely break unless that Person's thumbnail image is fixed.

  This has been corrected with additional checks in these rare cases. It will also use the Default Avatar in specific displays such as the Grid.

- ### Article List: Chronological Order

  ### Article List Page

  Previously an `Article List Page` could sometimes display `Articles` out of chronological order. This issue was due to the asynchronous nature of the chained API calls, which could cause `Articles` that required additional processing (e.g., generating a summary from the article body) to be placed out of order after processing completed as other earlier, more complete `Articles` "finished" before them.

  Now, all `Articles` are processed and appended to the page in their original order, ensuring the chronological display of articles. 

  Note: This did not seem to affect the other `Article List` style blocks, only the `Article List Page`

- ### Sidebar/Title Spacing Fixes

  Sidebar and Title spacing changes are fixed so that they align. The Title's container is what is aligned properly rather than the text in most cases as the font has a line-height that adds a little more padding around the text.

- ### People Lists: Corrects API error for >50 taxonomy terms

  The `People List Page` and the `People List Block` could run into an API error if there were >50 terms on a site for "Job Type" or "Department", due to how Drupal paginates API results to maintain performance. 

  On sites with >50 terms, this would cause a partial render of the page or block, and an error message displaying **"Error retrieving people from the API endpoint. Please try again later."** due to not having the complete list of taxonomies prior to filtering/sorting of the People.

  This has been corrected to work with an unlimited number of terms.

- ### Heading size fixes

  Updated the block-title class position so that the title class name is getting applied at the right level.

  Previously the block-title was wrapping the h2/h3/h4/h5/h6 so that the font-size wasn't getting applied correctly.
  Example: The block title is supposed to be 200% of the main font size (16px/1rem). That was getting applied on top of the 160% of h2 instead of h2.block-title just being made 200%. So instead of 32px it was becoming 52px. Essentially we were just double increasing, 16px\*160%\*200% rather than 16x\*200%.

  With the change of positioning on the block-title class that resolves this issue. It also fixes an issue with the block-title-increase/decrease options that we didn't know we had.

  This also tightens up the vertical spacing a bit with blocks/columns

  ### Adjusted Rendering Order on Article List Blocks (Article List Block, Article Grid Block, Article Feature Block) #1049

  - Previously a more complete Article could finish processing before one that needs additional calls to complete, such as one with a missing summary waiting for the Article body to finish processing (shortening, stripping elements, adding a `...` .) This could lead to an inconsistent order of Articles being displayed, despite a sort filter on the API call and the data coming back in the proper order. The `build` method on these components has been updated so that adding approved articles to the array of `final articles` (after include/exclude/fetching needed pieces/assembly/etc) are rendered in the order they are served by the API (by Date created) instead of as they come in completed.

  Also fixes bug with Article pages made without Summary content not getting the trimmed Article content correctly in the Article collection blocks/pages. This was due to a race condition and corrected with proper async/await.

- ### Block Alignments

  Made fixes to layout alignment so that blocks will always be synced.
  The main thing is that the left edge and right edge of the row content should align properly.

  Test by making tones of rows with different combos of frames and background colors with various different block types

- ### People List Page & People List Block - Bug Fixes & Edge Case Handling

  Provides the following bug fixes to the `People List Block` and the `People List Page`

  ## People List Page & People List Block

  - Fixes a bug with internal links throwing an error. Adjusts so internal links will convert to absolute pathing, which should allow for our multi-site, single domain sites to use internal links. 
  - No termId present on a Person causing a JavaScript error preventing a full render. Was able to cause this error with multiple people and one without any terms attached. This error was present on both `People List Page` and `People List Block`.
  - Swaps Twitter's bird to Twitter's X... ( X 's X?)...whatever you want to call it, the bird icon is now an X icon.

  ## People List Page Only

  - No terms existing for a taxonomy, and the `People List Page` having that taxonomy selected for `Group By` caused a white screen and no errors. Adjusted this to show an error specifying the reason for a white screen: `Grouping by ${groupBy} is requested, but taxonomy data is missing. Please adjust your page's 'Group By' setting or make sure taxonomy data exists for that term.`
  - Terms existing for a taxonomy and `Group By` for that taxonomy selected on a `Person List Page`... but no Person has terms on that taxonomy caused the same white screen. Adjusted this to show an error specifying this white screen case: `No results found for the '${groupBy}' grouping.`

- ### Newsletter: Minor Bug Fixes

  Adjusts the following on the Newsletter:

  - If user elects to omit the optional image on a _Newsletter Taxonomy_, it will no longer render that img element in the header
  - **Article Sections ( _Feature Style_ )** - For the Feature Style Article Sections, Articles without a thumbnail will check the Article for an Image uploaded as Article Content, and use that in place of a thumbnail if available. This functionality worked in the Teaser display, but there was an error that would prevent the backup image to display in the Feature Style render.

- ### Adds Styling to Newsletters

  Adds the following switchable styles to the email version of the Newsletter: Classic, Minimal, Light-Boxed, Dark-Boxed, Simple. 

  This change also applies the selected `Newsletter` taxonomy's custom header image and footer into your email HTML. 

  For testing:

  - Create a taxonomy for `Newsletter`-- choose a custom header image, create a footer, and select a style. 
  - Select this taxonomy when creating a Newsletter page.
  - After creating your page go to `Edit` and `Preview`. After selecting preview, on the right hand side change the `View Mode` dropdown to `Email: HTML`
  - If you click the `Click to copy your Newsletter HTML` button, your email HTML will automatically be copied to clipboard, or you can select the HTML from the input. You can demo this by creating an HTML file and doing a Live Preview, or using a program like Email on Acid to test display ( although this will not show images served by localhost)

  I recommend two tabs when testing styles, one with the Email:HTML preview and one with `Edit taxonomy` term to change styles or other fields, then just refresh the Email:HTML preview.

- ### Fixes List Indicator Alignment with Left Align Images

  This change aligns the list indicators on a list element with other text elements next to a left-aligned image. 

  Previously, the float css for aligning an element left would cause visual issues with list indicators specifically, the bullet-point or numbering becoming hard to see or lost within the image. There is now condtionally applied left-spacing to rendered Ordered and Unordered list elements, when directly next to a Left Align (.align-left) image.

- ### Remove Extra Markup from inserted Images

  Conditionally removes extra `<div>` elements added through Twig when there's no attributes to justify an additional `<div>` wrap of the rendered content.

  ## Article Block Bug Fix

  - Fixes bug with article summaries not displaying if they are derived from the body content, in lieu of the `Summary` field. This bug was present across `Article List Block`, `Article Grid Block`, `Article Feature Block` and has been corrected.

  * * *

  ## Style Adjustments

  Adjusts the following styles of the `Article List Block`:

  ### All `Article List Block` Styles

  - Thumbnail images set to 50px on mobile.
  - Article borders set to 1px.
  - `Link URL` is no longer a button-style link and is now a right-aligned basic link on the `Article List Block` specifically.

  ### Teaser Display

  - Sets thumbnails to 100px, 50px on mobile.
  - Adjusts layout to not force image above article card summary and details on single and multi column widths.

  ### Feature with Wide Photo

  - Uses the `Focal Image Wide` thumbnail for the images in `Article List Blocks` rendered in `Feature with Wide Photo` style. This image style was not previously available via JSON API when the block was initially created.

  ### Thumbnail & Title Displays

  - Thumbnail image 65px, 50px on mobile.
  - Equalizes padding above and below each article card, removing padding from images.

  Updated `footer.html.twig` to iterate through content so that it automatically adds columns (up to 4 per row)

  I left our current machine names for items like `left_sidebar` the same but changed their display names to match the ones given by Kevin to `Sidebar First`

  We also have logic written in the page.html.twig in case two sidebars are made through the block layout. Currently the settings only allow for one though.

  I have left social media menu and footer menu as regions for the time being because I think those need to be separate for menuing purposes at the moment.
