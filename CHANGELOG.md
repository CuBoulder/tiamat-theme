  Partially resolves #222 - Enhances the Newsletter for more consistency with final email html generation via Twig templating engine instead of JavaScript. Should resolve issues with inconsistent displays and partial/error renders from unexpected user inputs.
  
  TO DO - Will address `Newsletter Type` taxonomy and Theme selection in #273 
  
  ### New Workflow for Newsletters

  2.  In the top dropdown menu to select your View Mode, select `Email HTML` as your View Mode. The page will now render the Email HTML version.
  3.  Scroll to the bottom of your Email View Mode Preview for a button to automatically copy your html code to the clipboard ready to paste, as well as populate a text field with your email html.
  4. You can now paste into your email client / Salesforce client and send.

    -   Articles tagged with a private term can still be used to group those articles within Article Lists.
    -   Private terms are NOT used in the Related Articles block - private taxonomies do not affect an Articles 'related-ness' scores
    -   Private terms will not display in the Category/Tag link section on Articles

-   ### Fix for center-align images placed via CKEditor

    Images were left-aligned even when specified to be centered when placed from the media library via the CKEditor interface.  

    Captions are not being honored either, however this seems to be an issue with CKEditor 5 and the Drupal Media Library.  Should be fixed in a future version of Drupal : (see : <https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3246385> ) 

    Closes : #205 

* * *

-   ### Advanced Style Options for Articles: Title Background Image

    -   Issue Archive: a gallery linking to created Issues, newest first.

    ### Updated Content Types:

    -   Article - adds 'Appears in Issue' form selector to choose which Issue this Article appears in under the Article edit process. Will display this selected link to the Issue under Categories and Tags.

    -   Current Issue block: this block displays the current issue cover art and links to the current Issue.
    -   Latest Issue block: this block displays four of the latest issues and provides a link to to the Archives List page. You must have four or more issues for the archives link to appear on the block.
